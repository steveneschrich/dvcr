Description: Data Version Control (dvc) is a python tool <http://dvc.org> that
  provides data version control using git but only for hashes of files. The
  files themselves are managed outside of git (due to size constraints). DVC
  offers a way to combine data and R code without creating very large packages
  that are difficult to manage and distribute. This package wraps DVC in R
  functions to integrate into data science workflows. It is inspired by an
  existing package, <https://github.com/andrewcstewart/dvc-r>. The goal of this
  software is to create a minimalist wrapper around dvc.
